    <h1>Strawberry Cheesecake Bites Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These mini strawberry cheesecake bites are a cute two-bite dessert. Stuffed with a cream cheese filling, they can
        be prepared the night before â€” but not much earlier than that, as the berries may become soggy.</p>
