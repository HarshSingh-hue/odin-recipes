    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These mini strawberry cheesecake bites are a cute two-bite dessert. Stuffed with a cream cheese filling, they can
        be prepared the night before — but not much earlier than that, as the berries may become soggy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 large fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon canola oil (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Place graham cracker crumbs into a shallow bowl. </li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Spoon mixture into a piping bag
            fitted with a large round tip. </li>
        <li>With a sharp paring knife, cut a cone shape out of the top of each strawberry to leave a small hollow. Pipe
            about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into each strawberry, making sure the filling overflows a bit
            out of the top of the strawberry. Hold each strawberry upside down to dip filling into crumbs until coated.
        </li>
        <li>Melt chocolate and canola oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring
            after each interval, until warm and smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).</li>
        <li>Dip strawberry tips into melted chocolate, then place onto the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until
            set. </li>
    </ol>
