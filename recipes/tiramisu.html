    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian layered dessert with rum-flavored, coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a creamy mascarpone
        custard, and whipped cream. This tiramisu recipe is easy to make at home for an impressive no-bake dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Egg Yolks:</strong> Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some
            traditional
            recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet,
            creamy filling.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream:</strong> Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Mascarpone:</strong> Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a
            key ingredient
            in classic tiramisu.</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its
            signature flavor.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rum:</strong> Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers. Some
            Allrecipes community
            members say they prefer Kahlua.</li>
        <li><strong>Ladyfingers:</strong> Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick fingers. If you
            can't find
            ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong> Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.
        </li>
    </ul>
